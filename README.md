This is the source code repository for LuminousForts. To play the game, you will need the game files in the  [hekar/luminousforts](https://github.com/hekar/luminousforts) repository.

## Getting started

Clone the [LuminousForts](https://github.com/hekar/luminousforts) project into your `sourcemods` folder. Follow the instructions in [the repository for more information](https://github.com/hekar/luminousforts).

### Windows

#### Compile

1. Install [Visual Studio Community 2013](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older/downloads/)
1. Run `createallprojects.bat` in `mp\src`
1. Open the solution in Visual Studio 2013
1. Build Solution

#### Debug

Refer to the Valve Source SDK wiki for more information. In particular, the following pages are relevant:

- [Launching from Visual Studio 2013](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Launching_from_Visual_Studio_2013)
- [Debugging the Source Code](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Installing_and_Debugging_the_Source_Code)

### Linux

The Linux version of the Source SDK requires GCC 4.x due to ABI compatibility with statically linked libraries provided by Valve.

#### Compile

The easiest way to compile is with [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

```
docker-compose run lf /bin/bash
```

**Note**: Do not execute docker-compose as root. This mounts your `~/.steam` and will mount `/root/.steam` when executed with sudo.

#### Debug

You do not need to debug within the [docker](https://www.docker.com/) container. This can be executed from your host machine.
